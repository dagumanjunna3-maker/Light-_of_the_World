    <div class="h1"><p><u>Women’s Welfare and Empowerment Programs</u><br>
      Tangub City actively promotes gender equality and women’s welfare through initiatives<br>
      funded by its Gender and Development (GAD) fund. These programs include welfare support,<br>
       youth involvement activities, nutrition provision for children and pregnant women, and educational<br>
       campaigns on women’s rights conducted at the barangay level.<br>
      <u>Support for Women’s Associations and Livelihood</u><br>
      The city government encourages women’s participation in community development by providing<br>
       financial incentives to members of women’s associations during the annual National Women’s Month celebration.<br>
        These associations, with thousands of registered members, also receive support such as training<br>
         (e.g., making local products like piñato and malunggay polvoron) <br>
         and equipment like sewing machines during the COVID-19 pandemic to help sustain livelihoods. <br>
         <br>
         <u>Anti-Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation Services</u><br>
         Tangub City implements comprehensive anti-drug abuse programs through its City Anti-Drug Abuse Office.<br>
          This includes community-based drug rehabilitation programs, aftercare and reintegration services<br>
           for graduates of rehabilitation, drug education and advocacy campaigns, and support to<br>
            Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Councils.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Police-Led Community Outreach Activities</u><br>
            The Tangub City Police Station regularly conducts community outreach programs that serve children and families.<br>
             Activities such as the distribution of school bags, food, and interactive programs <br>
             (like mobile library storytelling) at local schools foster positive police–community<br>
              relations and support children’s education. <br>
              <br>
              <u>Culture of Volunteerism and Civic Participation</u><br>
              Beyond structured programs, Tangub City nurtures a strong culture of volunteerism.<br>
               Events like the Christmas Symbols Festival, for example, are sustained by the collective efforts<br>
                of volunteers from all walks of life, embodying a community spirit where citizens willingly<br>
                 contribute their time, skills, and resources toward shared goal.</p></div>
