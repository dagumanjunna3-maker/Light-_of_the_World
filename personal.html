    <div class="h1"><p>Tangub City is known not only for its beauty and orderliness but also for its<br>
       strong belief in the principle “God First.” As a resident/student of Tangub City, I am proud to belong to<br>
        a community where faith in God is an important part of everyday life.<br>
        <br>
        The phrase “God First” is more than just a slogan; it serves as a guide in making decisions<br>
         and facing challenges. It reminds me that before anything else, I should<br>
          place my trust in God and seek His guidance.<br>
          <br>
          In Tangub City, faith can be seen in the actions of the people.<br>
          Many activities in schools, offices, and communities begin with prayer, showing our<br>
           dependence on God in everything we do.<br>
           <br>
           As a young person, I have learned that putting God first helps develop discipline,<br>
            humility, and a sense of purpose. When I prioritize my relationship with God, I become more<br>
             focused and motivated in achieving my goals.<br>
             <br>
             Tangub City proves that progress and development can exist alongside strong faith.<br>
              The peace and order in the city reflect a community that values moral principles and respect for one another.<br>
              <br>
              In my personal experience, during times of difficulty and uncertainty,<br>
               the message “God First” gives me strength and hope. It reminds me that I am never<br>
                alone and that God is always guiding me.<br>
                <br>
                The people of Tangub City are known for being kind, respectful, and helpful.<br>
                 I believe these values are deeply rooted in the city’s commitment to faith and the teachings of God.<br>
                 <br>
                 Faith does not mean a life without problems, but it teaches us how to face<br>
                  challenges with courage, patience, and trust in God. This is an important lesson I<br>
                   continue to learn as a member of this community.<br>
                   <br>
                   The principle “God First” reminds me that true success is not measured<br>
                    by wealth or status, but by the goodness of our actions and our relationship with God and others.<br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, Tangub City is not just my home but also a source of inspiration.<br>
                     The value of putting God first is a lesson I will carry with me wherever I go,<br>
                     guiding me in my life today and in the future.</div>
